Live site at: https://statsearcher.azurewebsites.net/football/allPlayers

To run the project use the libraries specified in the requirements.txt and run on localhost.
Once on localhost type in localhost/football/search 
This will allow you to search any player listed in ESPN's API.

This is a program I made to pull football player's stats from ESPN using their API. The players are then stored in an internal database to prevent unnecessary API calls.
